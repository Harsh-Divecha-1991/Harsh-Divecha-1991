About Me
👋 Hi, I’m Harsh Divecha! I'm passionate about Cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data, identifying threats, and building secure systems. My goal is to safeguard digital environments and ensure robust security measures.

Current Role
🌱 I’m currently working as a Managed Service Technician at Xperience in London. My work involves threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and implementing security protocols to protect organizational data.

Collaboration Interests
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects. If you have a project or an idea where cybersecurity can make a difference, I’d love to hear about it and work together to create secure and resilient systems.

Cybersecurity Projects
🔒 Here are a few project ideas that I'm interested in and looking to collaborate on:

Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

Objective: Develop models to detect unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate potential security breaches.
Tools: Python, R, SQL, Machine Learning algorithms, Network traffic datasets.
Outcome: A system that alerts when potential threats are detected, helping in early identification and mitigation of cyber threats.
Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

Objective: Use machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time.
Tools: Python, R, SQL, Machine Learning algorithms, Financial transaction datasets.
Outcome: A robust fraud detection system that minimizes false positives and ensures secure financial operations.
Phishing Attack Detection

Objective: Analyze email data to identify phishing attempts using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
Tools: Python, R, SQL, NLP libraries, Email datasets.
Outcome: A tool that flags potential phishing emails, enhancing email security.
User Behavior Analytics (UBA)

Objective: Monitor and analyze user behavior to detect insider threats and unusual activities within an organization.
Tools: Python, R, SQL, Machine Learning algorithms, User activity datasets.
Outcome: A comprehensive UBA system that helps in identifying and preventing insider threats.
